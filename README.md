I have built using Tailwind, a showcase page for a shoe store to implement the concepts I'll cover next. Feel free to go live and see what it seems like to build a stunning website with TailwindCSS.

We are going to see, each core elements you should know from the begining, to be able to understand and code with TailwindCSS.

Feel free to go through the ROADMAP file i created, to see a logic flow of how you could proceed from scratch.
But first, let's answer one big question

Q: How would i describe Tailwind CSS with technical and specific words?
A: Well, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that lets you style your website directly in HTML using pre-defined, reusable classes. Utility-first because it mainly provides CSS utilities classes that are re-used at our conveniences. It is a Framework because it provides pre-made solutions that we are using the HTML tags.


*** 💡💡💡 TO KEEP IN MIND OVERALL 💡💡💡 ***

TailwindCSS is simply a framework that will help you style your web pages more easily. It will provide you with CSS classes that you will add in your HTML tags to get beautiful effects faster than with the usual CSS code, because here you add properties directly inside your HTML tag and in a simpler way. Just give it a try and you will see how cool it can be.
